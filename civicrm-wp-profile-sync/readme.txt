CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync keeps a WordPress and BuddyPress user profile in sync with a CiviCRM contact.


== Description ==

The CiviCRM WordPress Profile Sync plugin keeps the "First Name", "Last Name", "Email Address" and "Website" fields of a WordPress (and BuddyPress) user profile in sync with the corresponding fields of a CiviCRM contact. The synchronisation takes place regardless of whether the changes are made in WordPress, BuddyPress or CiviCRM.
